# Project 4 

## PA1 Changes
For my updates to this project I decided to include actual hangman pictures that change as a user makes and incorrect guess
and to change some general UI bugs such as making the previously guessed letters reset when a new game starts and to change the text of the button.
I didnt change too much for this project overall but it is now clean, well commented and ready to be displayed on a resume (I hope).

## PA2 Changes
My updates for this project include adding the functionality to fetch the photos from the gallery and to save photos from the gallery as well.
I also made sure to display the photos on the image buttons in the correct orientation instead of on its side. The UI stayed the same for the most
part but my mainActivity java class had a major rework. If you look at the code, you will see major changes when compared to my project 2 code
and it is now nicely commented

## PA3 Changes
For this app I messed around with the color pallette of the theme and added the ability to select photos from the user's gallery to be used.
I also greatly reduced the response time for the google API by compressing the image before it is sent off to be analyzed. I also changed a specific
layout that is displayed when the API incorrectly guesses what is in image by having the layout show what was returned by the vision API call.
My code is now nicely commented as well.
