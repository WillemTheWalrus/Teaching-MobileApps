# Summary:
For this project I learned how to implement the google cloud vision API and how, for some reason, it frequently thinks that I am a girl. Other than that, this project went pretty smoothly. This app prompts the user to take a picture and then sends it off to google to be analyzed by the vision API. This process normally takes 1 minute on my home wifi network. The vision API then returns information as to what it thinks is in the picture. The app then displays the description returned from vision and asks the user if it guessed correctly or not. I wrote this app to complete this homework assignment, but found that I rather enjoyed learning how to use the cloud vision API. It doesnt really serve any purpose other than to entertain the almighty user.
