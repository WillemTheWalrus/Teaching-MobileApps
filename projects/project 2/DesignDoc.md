                                                            Project 2 Design Doc
  Introduction: This project was brutal for me. I have just finished spending the last 5 hours trying to figure out how to save files to
  my device and make them display in the gallery app. I accomplished neither of these things. It is my fault for not giving myself enough time 
  to ask you questions in class about this, however I feel as if it is important that I mention this becaus ewhat I am turning in is a broken App.
  You cannot save photos, and if you wish to go back the original page to take another photo, you must first restart the app before 
  you can see new effects. I am sorry that I am turning in half a project but I hope to come in and get help with this project soon. Now to 
  show you what I have done so far.
  
  Requirements:
  * You need to be running an Android with at least API 18: 4.3(Jelly Bean) in order to run this App
  * The device must also have a camera equipped
  * There must be enough open storage to save files (for if and when the app is functional)
  
  Usage:
  
    Here is the starting UI, where you can either choose to take a picture or select one from the gallery
