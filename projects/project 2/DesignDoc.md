                                                            Project 2 Design Doc
  Introduction: This project was brutal for me. I have just finished spending the last 5 hours trying to figure out how to save files to
  my device and make them display in the gallery app. I accomplished neither of these things. It is my fault for not giving myself enough time 
  to ask you questions in class about this, however I feel as if it is important that I mention this becaus ewhat I am turning in is a broken App.
  You cannot save photos, and if you wish to go back the original page to take another photo, you must first restart the app before 
  you can see new effects. I am sorry that I am turning in half a project but I hope to come in and get help with this project soon. Now to 
  show you what I have done so far.
  
  Requirements:
  * You need to be running an Android with at least API 18: 4.3(Jelly Bean) in order to run this App
  * The device must also have a camera equipped
  * There must be enough open storage to save files (for if and when the app is functional)
  
  Usage:
  
   Here is the starting UI, where you can either choose to take a picture or select one from the gallery
   
 ![Starting Screen](https://github.com/WillemTheWalrus/Teaching-MobileApps/blob/master/projects/project%202/Screenshot_20180212-232318.png)
 
 On this page there is a textview, 2 buttons, and 9 image buttons. Upon selecting take a picture, you are then brought to this screen
 
 ![Take Photo](https://github.com/WillemTheWalrus/Teaching-MobileApps/blob/master/projects/project%202/Screenshot_20180212-232325.png)
 
 From here you can take a picture and then you will be asked to confirm the picture from this screen
 
 ![Confirm Photo](https://github.com/WillemTheWalrus/Teaching-MobileApps/blob/master/projects/project%202/Screenshot_20180212-232335.png)
 
 You will then be given a preview of all of the effects that can be applied to your photo and select one by pressing an image button
 
 ![choose effect](https://github.com/WillemTheWalrus/Teaching-MobileApps/blob/master/projects/project%202/Screenshot_20180212-232346.png)
 
 from here you will then be taken to an enlarged screen where you can choose to save you photo if that button was actually functional :(

 The only difference between selecting from a gallery and this option is that the gallery UI looks as such
 
 ![gallery select](https://github.com/WillemTheWalrus/Teaching-MobileApps/blob/master/projects/project%202/Screenshot_20180212-232407%20(2).png)
 
 
 Usage:
  1. If you wish to take a picture, press 'take a picture'. If you with to select a photo from your gallery, select 'pick a picture'.
  2. From here if you selected 'pick a picture', then select the photo that you wish to have modified. I you chose 'take a picture', use
      your camera device to take and confirm a picture for editing
  3. Now press the image button for the effect you would like to have applied to your picture
  4. From here, if the saving function actually worked, you would press save image and then be redirected to the first screen. 
      Unfortunately I was unable to figure out how to do this. I will see you later this week with questions.
