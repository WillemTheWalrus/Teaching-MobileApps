  Introduction: This project was brutal for me. I have just finished spending the last 5 hours trying to figure out how to save files to
  my device and make them display in the gallery app. I accomplished neither of these things. It is my fault for not giving myself enough time 
  to ask you questions in class about this, however I feel as if it is important that I mention this becaus ewhat I am turning in is a broken App.
  You cannot save photos, and if you wish to go back the original page to take another photo, you must first restart the app before you can see new effects.
